# Super Moon Attack
##Project Description

This is a game that I'm making to learn Python project structures and how to implement classes. 

It's a basic flying sidescroller game where the player battles aliens above the moon. 

##Status

Incomplete. The game is running, the player can fire at and destroy aliens for points. I need to flesh it out more and create level progression, enemy attacks, a main menu, scoreboard, and more enemies.
